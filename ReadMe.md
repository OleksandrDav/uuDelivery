# Courier Delivery Management System

## Description

Our product is an integrated web application designed to streamline the delivery process for courier companies while providing real-time tracking and monitoring of assets. The system allows delivery couriers to view orders assigned to them, select an order for delivery, and receive instructions to place a tracker on the asset. Once the tracker is in place, the courier confirms the delivery, initiating real-time tracking.

Customers receive email notifications with a link to the web application, where they can monitor the status of their delivery. This includes real-time GPS location tracking, as well as temperature monitoring and with the integration of accelerometers into our asset trackers for sensitive assets. Upon delivery, the courier can mark the order as complete within the application.

## Solved Problems

### 1. Lost or Delayed Deliveries
Couriers may encounter issues such as lost or delayed deliveries, leading to customer dissatisfaction. Our solution provides real-time tracking, enabling both couriers and customers to monitor the progress of deliveries and address any potential delays proactively.

### 2. Temperature Fluctuations
Temperature-sensitive assets require careful monitoring during transit to ensure they remain within specified temperature ranges. Our system provides real-time temperature monitoring, alerting managers if there are any deviations from the required conditions, allowing for immediate action to be taken to mitigate risks.

### 3. Communication Breakdown
Lack of communication between couriers, customers, and managers can lead to confusion and errors in the delivery process. Our platform facilitates seamless communication through email notifications, providing updates on delivery status and any issues encountered during transit.

### 4. Risk of Improper Handling
Assets may suffer damage or malfunction if improperly handled during transit, affecting customer satisfaction. With accelerometer integration, our solution detects and alerts couriers of any instances where assets are placed in undesirable positions, mitigating the risk of damage.
